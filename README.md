## How to Play

### Juggling
- Tap near the ball to juggle it — keep it in the air!
- Your juggle count climbs with each successful tap
- Drop the ball and you can choose to **Carry On** (keep your score) or **Clear Score** (start fresh)

### Trapping & Shooting
- Once you hit the juggle target (starts at **5**), the **TRAP** button unlocks
- Tap **TRAP** to freeze the ball and enter aiming mode
- **Drag** anywhere on screen to set your aim direction and power
- Use the **CURVE ◀ ▶** buttons to bend the ball left or right
- Tap the screen to shoot — you have **10 seconds** to take your shot

### Scoring
- Score a goal and your juggle target goes up by 5 (5 → 10 → 15 → ...)
- Your **top score** is saved on your device across sessions
- Beat the goalkeeper and the defensive wall to score!

### Tips
- Shoot from **close range with high power** and the ball can fly over the bar
- Click **left of the curve centre** to bend right, **right** to bend left
- The **wall** blocks central shots — use curve to go around it
- The **goalkeeper** keeps moving even while you aim — time your shot!
